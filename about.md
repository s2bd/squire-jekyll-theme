  <h1>About the Squire</h1>

  <p class="lead">Greetings, noble reader! You have entered the digital halls of {{ site.author }}, where knowledge flows like wine at a royal feast and wisdom is shared with the generosity of a benevolent lord.</p>

  <h2>The Quest</h2>
  <p>This chronicle serves as both sanctuary and scriptorium—a place where thoughts are forged in the fires of contemplation and shaped by the hammer of experience. Here, every word is chosen with the care of a master craftsman, every sentence built with the precision of a cathedral architect.</p>

  <h3>What You'll Discover</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tales of knowledge and wisdom gathered from distant realms</li>
    <li>Chronicles of discovery and learning in the modern age</li>
    <li>Insights crafted with the patience of a monastery scribe</li>
    <li>Reflections on the art of living with purpose and intention</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Scribe's Creed</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In an age of endless noise and fleeting attention, we choose depth over breadth, quality over quantity, and timeless wisdom over trending topics. Every piece published here is crafted to endure, like the great works that have guided humanity through the ages.</p>
  </blockquote>
