  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>This is a minimalistic Jekyll site built with love and attention to detail. I'm {{ site.author }}, and this is my personal blog where I share thoughts, ideas, and projects.</p>

  <p>The design focuses on readability and user experience, making it perfect for long-form content and extensive reading sessions. Every element has been carefully crafted to reduce eye strain and enhance the reading experience.</p>

  <p>Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> if you'd like to connect or discuss any of the topics covered here.</p>
